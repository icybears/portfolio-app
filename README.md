# Portfolio Web app
This Laravel based web application allows users to create their personal portfolio page where they can add their bio and social links aswell as showcase their experiences and projects. It also uses some jQuery libraries like a Markdown Editor to write custom content.

This application is currently hosted at: http://forewords.herokuapp.com/ (note that initial page loading might be slow since I'm using heroku's free tier)
